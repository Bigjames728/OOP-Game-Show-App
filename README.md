# OOP Game Show App
 
This is a web based app game where a random phrase populates the screen and you have to guess letters aiming to guess the phrase.
When you guess an incorrect letter, or a letter that is not in the phrase, you loose a life (you have 5 lives total). When you guess 
a correct letter, the letter fills in its spot on the board.

This was an extremely challenging project for me and I plan on digging deeper into object oriented programming as I progress in
my career.
